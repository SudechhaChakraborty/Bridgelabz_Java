# 13th December 2025
Practiced Java methods, including method creation and invocation, handling parameters, return types, and implementing simple method-driven programs.

# 15th December 2025
Solved Programming Elements problems (Level 1 and Level 2) using user-defined methods and command-line input. Worked on basic computational logic and real-world problem-solving scenarios in Java.

# 16th December 2025
Practiced control flow concepts in detail, including conditional statements, looping constructs (for, while, do-while), and switch cases. Completed Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 practice exercises.

# 17th December 2025
Worked extensively on Java arrays by solving Level 1 and Level 2 problems, covering both one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays along with logical problem-solving techniques.

# 18th December 2025
Practiced Java methods (Level 1 and Level 2) and applied them to real-world problem scenarios. Improved code structure and reusability, and organized the work using a branch-based GitHub repository structure.

# 19th December 2025
Practiced Java Strings, covering string creation, common string methods, immutability, and solving basic string-based problems.

# 20th December 2025
Covered additional Java topics and miscellaneous concepts, including revision of previously learned material and practice of extra problem sets.

# 22nd December 2025
Learned Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals, including classes and objects. Practiced creating and using objects through Level 1 lab exercises.

# 23rd December 2025
Worked on Java constructors, instance variables vs. class variables, and access modifiers. Completed Level 1 lab practice to reinforce core object-oriented concepts.

# 8th January 2026
Practiced GitFlow workflow through hands-on execution. Created and configured a GitHub repository, initialized GitFlow, worked with feature branches, merged changes into the develop branch, created and completed release and hotfix branches, generated version tags, and pushed main, develop, and tags to GitHub.

# 9th January 2026
Worked on Level 1 lab practice covering Java keywords such as static and final, and practiced the instanceof operator. Completed and submitted the assigned lab tasks.

# 10th January 2026
Studied Object-Oriented Design Principles and completed the submissions of Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams, and Sequence Diagrams.

# 12th January 2026
Learned inheritance concepts in Java, including single-level, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance. Studied key features of inheritance, method overriding, constructor inheritance, the relationship between polymorphism and inheritance, and the role of access modifiers in inheritance.

# 13th January 2026
Covered core object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation and polymorphism, and learned the implementation and use of interfaces and abstract classes in Java.

# 14th January 2026
